#  Notes

1. Set the privacy options.
  Add these 2 properties to the info.plist file:
    `Privacy - Location Always and When In Use Usage Description`
   `Privacy - Location Always Usage Description`
  A descripter is used to explain to the user why.
    eg: "Your location is required to give you accurate weather data for your area."

2. Create a generic `Network Manager` for API calls. 
  `NetworkManager.swift`
